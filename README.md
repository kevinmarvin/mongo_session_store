# MongoSessionStore

## Description

This is a fork of the DataMapper session store, modified to work with MongoMapper and Mongoid, in the new Rails 3 environment.

There's a detailed tutorial on http://www.nicolaracco.com/articles/rails3-application-with-mongodb
For a short tutorial, read on:


## To Install
